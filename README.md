Unfinished Idea!

This is an idea for a macro-economic strategic risk management plugin for Obsidian Notes using JavaScript and the Obsidian plugin API. A strategic risk management plugin could help users identify, assess, and prioritise risks that could impact their business or organisation, and take proactive steps to mitigate those risks.

Written in JavaScript code this plugin isusing the Obsidian API and the LYT kit.

Possible Roadmap:

1. Contact management system that will link risks.
2. ML decision tree model applied to make recommendation for planning and highlight potential risks associated to governments, companies, idividuals.
3. Risk matrix integration.
4. Categories of risks to be defined by the user with a ML function applied.
5. Upload documents to a database.
6. This is just a thought and I will never complete this, as the final possbility.

An idea will be to  host the ML models on a separate system and use the Obsidian plugin API to access them via an API endpoint.
This would allow you to use more powerful hardware and infrastructure for training and serving the ML models, without having to include the entire ML library in in the plugin. You could then use the Obsidian plugin API to make HTTP requests to the API endpoint and receive the results from the ML models, which you could then use to update the plugin state or display in Obsidian.
*Most likely I will start with a Docker for this seperate system
